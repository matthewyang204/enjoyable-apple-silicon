Enjoyable is an application for Mac OS X which allows you to use
controller inputs like a mouse or keyboard.

[中文说明](README.zh-CN.md)

This repository is maintained from the upstream project at
[matthewyang204/Enjoyable](https://github.com/matthewyang204/Enjoyable).

If you've ever played a video game which only supports mouse and
keyboard input but you want to use a joystick or gamepad, then
Enjoyable will help you do that.

Enjoyable supports

 * Mapping gamepad and joystick buttons to keyboard and mouse actions
 * Fine control over mouse movement and scrolling using analog axis
   inputs
 * Automatic and dynamic switching between different input mappings
 * Downloading and sharing input presets for different applications
 * Modern OS X features like resume and automatic termination

Enjoyable is free software written by Joe Wreschnig with minor additions
by Sam Deane, and is based on the Enjoy codebase written by [Yifeng Huang](http://nongraphical.com)
and [Sam McCall](http://abstractable.net/enjoy/).

## How to Use

To start, just press a button on your joystick or gamepad, then press
the key you want to map it for. Then press the ▶ button and switch
back to your game. For more details, Enjoyable has a in-application
manual available in Help Viewer via `⌘?`.

## Requirements

* Mac OS X 11+
* One or more HID-compatible (e.g. USB or Bluetooth) input devices

# Building
For day-to-day local development, use the root `Makefile`:

```bash
make build
make run
```

Useful aliases:

```bash
make open
make install
make release
make install-release
make clean
```

If `xcodebuild` says you have not agreed to the Xcode license yet, run:

```bash
sudo xcodebuild -license
```

## Installing On Your Mac

Install the current build into `~/Applications`:

```bash
make install
```

Install a Release build instead:

```bash
make install-release
```

If you prefer to install it manually, build first and then copy
`build/Build/Products/Debug/Enjoyable.app` into `Applications` or
`~/Applications`.

If you just want to get a binary of the architecture of your current computer, just run Product > Build in Xcode. However, if you want a universal binary for distribution on other websites, here's how:
1. Clone and `cd` into the repo
2. Run `xcodebuild -project Enjoyable.xcodeproj -scheme Enjoyable -configuration Release -arch arm64 -derivedDataPath ./build build` and copy the resulting app bundle to another location, such as the Downloads folder. You'll need it later.
3. Run `xcodebuild -project Enjoyable.xcodeproj -scheme Enjoyable -configuration Release -arch x86_64 -derivedDataPath ./build build` and copy the resulting app bundle to the same location as you copied the first bundle, but just with a number after it.
4. Copy the binary within the first bundle's MacOS folder into the second bundle's MacOS folder with `Enjoyable2` as its name and then delete the first bundle.
5. Append a `1` to the remaining bundle's original binary's filename. The first binary should be named `Enjoyable1` by now.
6. `cd` into the bundle's MacOS folder and then run `lipo -create -output Enjoyable Enjoyable1 Enjoyable2`
7. Delete `Enjoyable1` and `Enjoyable2` and then run `killall Finder` to restart Finder's metadata cache. The bundle should now show up as Universal.

# Blocked execution
If your Mac says something like "Unidentified developer" in a pop-up when you try to open the app, try running this in a terminal under an administrator account:
```
sudo spctl --master-disable
```
